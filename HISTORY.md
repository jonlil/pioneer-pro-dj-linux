## History

In this file I will try to add important milestones/achievements in a happy format.

#### 2019-03-14
General cleaning and re-arranging code. Also renamed to project to `TermDJ`.
Name is short for Terminal DJ.

#### 2019-03-13
Managed to automate network discovery. I.E. find the interface/network address that CD-players
broadcast on. Use that network and send out initial linking / broadcasting packages.

#### 2019-03-12
Manged to finally get my XDJ-700 to respond to the network traffic.
The key part is to send packages in the right order and to package correct IP-address and MAC address.

I also decided to purge the old master branch and rebuild this from the ground and up.
Test coverage wasn't the greatest on the old branch. Notice: the old branch is kept and is named `old-master`.
