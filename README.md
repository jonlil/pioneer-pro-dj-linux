Terminal based compatible Rekordbox DJ Application for linux

Since Pioneer doesn't bother to build this for Linux I decided to testing building it my-self.

Hopefully one day this application will be able to send files to a rekordbox compatible DJ player.
Progress might be slow since rekordbox uses an closed protocol for it's data transmission.

### Disclaimer
This will not try to become a Rekordbox GUI application for linux.
Mentions of rekordbox should only occur when interactions is made
with real hardware Pioneer equipment.
