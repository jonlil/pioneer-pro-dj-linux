# TermDJ - Terminal DJ
------------------------------------------------------

Terminal based cross-platform Rekordbox compatible DJ Application for nerdz.

Since Pioneer doesn't bother to build this for Linux I decided to testing building it my-self.
Progress might be slow since rekordbox uses an closed protocol for it's data transmission.

### Disclaimer
This will not try to become a Rekordbox GUI application for linux.
Mentions of rekordbox should only occur when interactions is made
with real hardware Pioneer equipment.
