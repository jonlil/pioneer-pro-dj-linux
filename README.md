# Terminal emulated Pioneer PRO DJ Application for linux

Since Pioneer doesn't bother to build this for Linux I decided to testing building it my-self.

Hopefully one day this application will be able to send files to a rekordbox compatible DJ player.
Progress might be slow since rekordbox uses an closed protocol for it's data transmission.
